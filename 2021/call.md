# First Workshop on Causal Inference & NLP

We invite papers broadly related to the intersection of causal inference
and NLP. Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

   * **Causal inference methodology for language:** Includes methodology for causal
     inference and optimal policy learning with experimental or observational data,
     where text is a treatment, outcome, mediator or moderator. 

   * **Language processing systems and causality:** Includes research on
     counterfactual predictions with text, causal model interpretation and
     explanation, causal model debiasing, and datasets to benchmark
     the sensitivity and robustness of causal NLP systems.

   * **Society, language, and causality:** Includes research on language as a
     mechanism of influence and provocation, and causal questions related to
     linguistic framing, medical notes and clinical outcomes, and political
     messaging and propaganda.
