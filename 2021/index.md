# First Workshop on Causal Inference & NLP

## November 10/11, 2021 at [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/)

The CI+NLP workshop brings together domain and methodological experts
across academic communities, with an interest in the intersection of causal
inference and natural language processing. Together, we will explore how current and new NLP methodology
can contribute to establishing and evaluating causal relationships, and how
substantive expertise from different domains can contribute to answering causal
questions with text.
