## Panel Discussion

For our panel discussion, we have invited experts in NLP and causal inference to discuss their recent work at this intersection and vision for the future. We will discuss both estimating causal effects from text and using causality to better inform NLP prediction.

**Panelists:**

   * Aron Culotta, Tulane, http://cs.tulane.edu/~aculotta/
   * Amir Feder, Technion, https://amirfeder.github.io/
   * Jacob Eisenstein, Google, https://jacobeisenstein.github.io/
   * Dhanya Sridhar, University of Montreal, https://dsridhar91.github.io/
   * Brandon Stewart, Princeton, https://scholar.princeton.edu/bstewart/home
   * Justin Zhang, Stanford, https://tisjune.github.io/


## Accepted Papers

**Note:** Accepted papers will be shared via live 10-minute presentations
during the paper oral sessions. Attendees will have the opportunity
to interact further with paper authors during the poster session.
